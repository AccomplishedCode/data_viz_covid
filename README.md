# data_viz_covid

This is a simple visualization dashboard built using Plotly and Dash to visualize the total number of COVID cases in the US as compared to the state of New York and the City of New York. 

To run the app, please create a new python virtual environment, and install the libraries listed in requirements.txt using the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt 

After install, all you need to do is run "python app.py" . This will start a local server on your machine, which you can visit and then visualize. The project is set up to load data published by the New York Times.
